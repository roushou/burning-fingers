# Burning Fingers

This is a little Computer Vision project built using OpenCV, MediaPipe and Python.

It detects your index and middle fingers from both of your hands then creates flames from them.

## Getting started

I'm using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage this project.

Create a virtual env.

```bash
uv venv
```

Activate the virtual env according to your shell. Here's with Fish shell.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate.fish
```

Run the app

```bash
uv run main.py
```
